# A self-tutorial on using Python and machine learning packages to develop an AI which plays the game: Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%e2%80%93paper%e2%80%93scissors

I document my attempt in a series of self-tutorials, each a Jupyter Notebook, each exporting the concepts or building code which hopefully will lead to a final algorithm that plays RPS and modifies its strategy based on the results of previous games.

### Tutorial One
* Introduction to Python and Markdown. 
* Outline of our goal

### Tutorial Two
* More Python
* Using Python libraries
* The importance of saving game history

### Tutorial Three
* Representing a single game of RPS
* Representing a collection of games (game history)

### Tutorial Four
* Introduction to Pandas DataFrame class
* Use DataFrame to store game history
* Generating random play
