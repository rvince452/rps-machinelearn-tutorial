    "### Using the DataFrame to represent RPS games\n",
    "In the last tutorial, we saw how to represent a RPS game using a Python class which we wrote. But we will not use that class, instead we will use a class from a third party library.\n",
    "The class we will use is the DataFrame class from the Pandas package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  By choosing an existing, proven, third-party class, we can worry more about our AI logic and less about writing Python classes\n",
    "1.  The DataFrame class is extremely flexible and powerful\n",
    "1.  Most importantly, many existing Machine Learning packages work with DataFrames. So by starting with DataFrames, we will more easily be able to implement Machine Learning algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving/loading a list of games\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we saw how to represent a collection of RPS class instances. When we switch to using Pandas DataFrames, we will find that not only will it be able to represent a single game, it will be able to represent a collection of games. **Futher**, it will be able to save/load those as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is an important part of the outline for our AI game:\n",
    "1.  Load the history of previous games\n",
    "1.  Analyze that history and formulate a strategy\n",
    "1.  Play a game and store results\n",
    "1.  Re-examine history and make changes.\n",
    "1.  When done playing, store all game results for next time\n",
