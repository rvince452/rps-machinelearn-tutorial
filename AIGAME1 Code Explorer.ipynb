    "# Machine Learning Tutorial by way of Pandas, Python and Rock, Paper, Scissors\n",
    "Welcome, this is a tutorial which I am writing to organize what i've learned in the last year and also to be the kind of introduction which i wished i could find back when i started.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this less-than-ten part tutorial, i intend to create a working AI which 'learns' how to play the game Rock, Paper Scissors. To get there i will use Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, Markdown and Sci-Kit Learn's machine learning packages. Yes, you could develop an AI using various packages and languages but i am telling which road i'll take here. No matter how you go, multiple tools and technologies need to be leveraged.\n",

    "We'll build up some code which will help us reach our goal\n",

    "\n",
    "### Our final goal\n",
    "Is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can play Rock, Paper, Scissors which a human competitor AND it can learn from those games and improve its play. The latter piece is what makes it AI/Machine Learning. The smartest chess game in the world is, by definition, not AI unless it changes (presumably improves) its play based on previous games.\n",

    "### Markdown\n",
    "Each section of the notebook can be of two types: code and markdown. Markdown is used to document. This section is written in Markdown. See more below\n",

    "### Pandas\n",
    "Pandas is Python package used to load, manipulate and store large arrays. But it also does the same with DataFrames. A DataFrame is like a spreadsheet or a database table. Using DataFrames one can load, manipulate/transform and save large tables of related information. \n",
