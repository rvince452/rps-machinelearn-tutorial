    "# Machine Learning Tutorial by way of Pandas, Python and Rock, Paper, Scissors\n",
    "Welcome, this is a tutorial I am writing to organize what I've learned in the last year concerning Machine Learning and Python. I'm also trying to make it the kind of introduction I wished I could have found back when I started. Don't get me wrong, I found many helpful tutorials, but so much of it was new, I just needed everything to go very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll do my best.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this series of tutorials, i intend to create a working AI which 'learns' how to play the game Rock, Paper Scissors. To get there i will use Jupyter Notebooks, Python, Pandas, Markdown and Sci-Kit Learn's machine learning packages. I think the fact that one must use so many different tools makes it more difficult to learn, but I'll try to start with the basics of each, introducing them only when needed.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Our final goal\n",
    "Is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can play the children's game: Rock, Paper, Scissors. It should be able to play against a human competitor AND it should learn from those games and improve its play. The latter piece is what makes it AI/Machine Learning. The smartest chess game in the world is, by definition, not AI unless it changes (presumably improves) its play based on previous games.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outline of our proposed AI:\n",
    "1.  Load the history of previous games\n",
    "1.  Analyze that history and create a play strategy\n",
    "1.  Play a game and store results\n",
    "1.  Re-examine history and make changes.\n",

    "Pandas is Python package used to load, manipulate and store large arrays. But it also does the same with DataFrames. A DataFrame is like a spreadsheet or a database table. Using DataFrames one can load, manipulate/transform and save large tables of related information. \n",
